And now my favorite albums:

`1.` _MOTOMAMI_ by Rosalía

It's a perfect combination of the trap from the Bad Bunny album, the dance from the Beyonce album and the angst from the Ethel Cain album. "HENTAI" has the most delicate Pharrell piano composition contrasting Rosalía's brash lyrics, the drums on "CUUUUuuuuuute" sound like they're coming from an empty warehouse, I feel like I'm on the most extravagant shopping trip with my besties on "LA COMBI VERSACE"... My head swirls from the conversations on Rosalía's "colonization" for her Daddy Yankee flip, a topic I've got no expertise on. "SAOKO" and the whole album really is a triumphant gesture of deference to the royalty of reggaeton, in my view.

 `2.` _Natural Brown Prom Queen_ by Sudan Archives

Flawless sonic quality in headphones, there's no album more authentic than this one. I'm so loyal.

`3.` _Preacher's Daughter_ by Ethel Cain

Meaghan Garvey best captured this album as driving through the middle of nowhere with "HELL IS REAL" billboards. Probably my most played album, I was constantly craving the dread in the middle of the tracklist.

`4.` _Cheap Phones and Turkey Bags_ by Starlito, Troy Money

The only album that literally captures what it was like to live through this year. Gas prices high as fuck.

`5.` _mediopicky_ by mediopicky

`6.` _Un Verano Sin Ti_ by Bad Bunny

I think I'm going to ask an artist to tattoo the album cover's heart on me? I love the album and the album art a lot. Summer in an album.

`7.` _Renaissance_ by Beyonce

My friend Mike talked about how good this album is and mentioned how only Beyonce could afford these beats. 

`8.` _God Save the Animals_ by Alex G

Miracles and crosses, miracles and crosses, miracles and crosses..

`9.` _Las Ruinas_ by Rico Nasty

`10.` _Ants from Up There_ by Black Country, New Road

I spent my winter running to this album. Mr. Isaac Wood, I hope you're doing well!

Honorable mentions: _Being Funny in a Foreign Language_ by The 1975, _Bin Reaper 3: Old Testament_ and _MegaTron_ by BabyTron, _Honestly, Nevermind_ by Drake
