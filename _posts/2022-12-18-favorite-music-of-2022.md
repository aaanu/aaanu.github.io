And now my favorite albums:

`1.` <span style="color:black">_MOTOMAMI_ by Rosalía</span>

It's a perfect combination of the trap from the Bad Bunny album, the dance from the Beyoncé album and the angst from the Ethel Cain album. "HENTAI" has the most delicate Pharrell piano composition contrasting Rosalía's brash lyrics, the drums on "CUUUUuuuuuute" sound like they're coming from an empty warehouse, I feel like I'm on the most extravagant shopping trip with my besties on "LA COMBI VERSACE"... My head swirls from the conversations on Rosalía's "colonization" for her Daddy Yankee flip, a topic I've got no expertise on. "SAOKO" and the whole album really is a triumphant gesture of deference to the royalty of reggaeton, in my view.

 `2.` <span style="color:black">_Natural Brown Prom Queen_ by Sudan Archives</span>

Flawless sonic quality in headphones, there's no album more authentic than this one. I'm so loyal.

`3.` <span style="color:black">_Preacher's Daughter_ by Ethel Cain</span>

In one of Meaghan Garvey's wonderful reviews on this record, she imagines Ethel Cain has driven past plenty of evangelical "HELL IS REAL" billboards [(link)](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/31/1101331627/ethel-cain-preachers-daughter-review). Probably my most played album, I was constantly craving the dread in the middle of the tracklist.

`4.` <span style="color:black">_Cheap Phones and Turkey Bags_ by Starlito, Troy Money</span>

The only album that literally captures what it was like to live through this year. Gas prices high as fuck.

`5.` <span style="color:black">_Un Verano Sin Ti_ by Bad Bunny</span>

I think I'm going to ask an artist to tattoo the album cover's heart on me? I love the album and the album art a lot. Summer in an album.

`6.` <span style="color:black">_American Heartbreak_ by Zach Bryan</span>

Probably my surprise pick, but it was year-round comforting to fall back on this album for good ol' acoustic guitar, harmonica and raspy singing.

`7.` <span style="color:black">_Renaissance_ by Beyoncé</span>

My friend Mike, when talking about how good this album is, mentioned how only Beyoncé could *afford* to gather these producers, these beats, these samples and these co-writers together for a record. It's true and it pays off; it's a perfect front-to-back record of ballroom, 90s club, PC music influence, dance music, Nile Rodgers, Skrillex, Grace Jones.. the list goes on. I don't give out #1s on my list for lavishness, so Beyoncé gets #7 on my list.

`8.` <span style="color:black">_It's Almost Dry_ by Pusha T</span>

"Rock N Roll" is soooooo good, and I think I cried the first time I heard No Malice on "I Pray for You". There's no misses here.

`9.` <span style="color:black">_God Save the Animals_ by Alex G</span>

Miracles and crosses, miracles and crosses, miracles and crosses.

`10.` <span style="color:black">_Ants from Up There_ by Black Country, New Road</span>

I spent my winter running laps in Prospect Park to this album. Mr. Isaac Wood, I hope you're doing well!
